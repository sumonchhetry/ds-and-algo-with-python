                        # DS and algorithm in Python #

1. What is data structure ?
A. Data structures are different ways to organise the data on a machine which can be used efficiently.

2. What is algorithm ?
A. A set of instructions to complete a certain task especially by computers.

3. What makes a good algorithm ?
A. Correctness and Efficiency

4. The importance of DS and algorithm ?
A. As a software developer or computer scientist it is our responsibility to perform operations on data, DS and algorithm helps us in that process.

5. How many types of Data Structures are there ?
A.  1. Primitive
    2. Non Primitive

    5.1 Types of primitive data structure:
    a. Integer
    b. Float
    c. Character
    d. String
    e. Boolean

    5.2 Types of non primitive data structure:
    a. Linear
    b. Non Linear

    5.2.a Types of Linear data structure:
    a. Static
    b. Dynamic

    5.2.b Types of Non Linear data structure:
    a. Tree
    b. Graph

    5.2.a.a Types of Leanier Static data structure:
    a. Array

    5.2.a.b Types of Leanier Dynamic data structure:
    a. Linked List
    b. Stack
    c. Queue

6. Different types of Algorithm:
A.  a. Simple recursive algorithm
    b. Devide and conqure algorithm
    c. Dynamic programming algorithm
    d. Greedy algorithm
    e. Brite force algorithm
    f. Randomized algorithm




3 steps to write recursive functions
    a. Recursive case - the flow
    b. Base case - The stopping criterion
    c. Unintentional case - the constraint
